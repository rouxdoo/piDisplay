##  piDisplay
This app was designed to allow ios deviced to control the backlight and brightness of the official 7 inch touchscreen display sold by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

* This display connects to the pi through the DSI port not HDMI.
* Other displays will not work with this app.
* This has only been tested on raspbian stretch
* This has only been tested on a pi 3B+

SwiftServer communication is super speedy but requires listening server running on the pi
